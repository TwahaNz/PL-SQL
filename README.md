# PL-SQL
Simple demonstration of using CRUD statements with SQL. The repository only contains one file this is the
crud_demonistration.sql.

To the script, you will need to have Oracle Client on your machine. The script can than be ran
with SQL Developer or SQL/PLUS or any of the equivalent tools that can run the oracle sql.

The script creates a table called 'Team' and also manupilate this table using CRUD.
